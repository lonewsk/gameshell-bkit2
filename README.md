## Story
As I played again and again with my Gameshell, I grew tired of having to recharge it often through a long gaming session, so I decided to update the battery to one with a larger capacity.

I chose 18650 batteries, for they are cheap, easy to find, and much reusable. I also enjoy the form-factor, making it looks like old-school Gameboy batteries.


## What you'll need

- A 3D printer (battery holder, back plate)
- A hot-glue gun (or plastic-specific glue)
- Connectors (or soldering iron)


## Battery holder

I used the "Flexing battery holder" from enif on Thingiverse [(link here)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:456900)


## Back plate

In this repo, you'll find the 3D .STL file to print your own custom back plate.

*Please note that it is still a draft. I plan to close the back plate soon.*
